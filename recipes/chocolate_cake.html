            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a cake pan.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time,
                    then stir in vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Gradually mix in the dry ingredients alternately with milk. Stir in hot water until batter is
                    smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into
                    the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and cool completely on a wire
                    rack.</li>
                <li>If desired, frost the cake with chocolate frosting once it has cooled. Serve and enjoy!</li>
